This week we primarily met up in our horizontal groups and discussed how we shold approach the problem at hand. Each of the groups and their roadblocks and progress can be summarized as follows. 

#Data Curators
Roadblocks: Merge conflicts, 
Data Curation To Do List: google spreadsheet that other gruops will acess, clean data for NAs, finalize scope of project (Southern California), share preliminary data

#Analyzers
Roadblocks: matlab requires paid license, confusing instructions, trouble organizing work in 11-person group
Accomplishments: established communication flow
Questions: What should we do with 'given' code?

#Visualizers
Roadblocks: Learning the needed tools, understanding the 'thesis' of the project, coordinating schedules, how to delegate tasks within the groups
Accomplishments: We posted notes, we read the papers, agreed on centralized communication

#Integrators/Presenters
Roadblocks: Midterms, understanding how to cite resources. Only met twice as a group
Accomplishments: Created a chart and decided on a repository.


From there I formed my own checklist that I had to accomplish by next time

Personal to do list:
Figure out the parameters of ETAS model
Learn the Luren model 


A good summary of what we want to investigate with regards to our model is as follows:

Our overall aim with regard to earthquakes. 
Once an earthquake happens, that another earthquake will happen.
Alarm earthquake model- turn on a alarm. when there is an alarm, you create a window where there MIGHT be another earthquake

If an earthquake happens, you put everybody on alert that there might be an earthquake in the future

Tradeoff: if you leave it on, you will catch more earthquakes but the higher the cost is of everyone being on alert.
If you keep the alarm on forever, you would be right 100% but at high cost.
So you only have the window for a certain time. But you can then miss events.
Two parameters that are important (tau = cost, nu = how many incidents you missed according to your strategy)
tau = \frac{integral from 0 to t H(t)dt (how long is alarm on) / T

Want to optimize the curve so you have a good cost to false negative ratio.

nu = \frac{earhquakes missed}{total number of earthquakes}
Measuring the success of an alarm strategy

W(M) = k \mu ^ M

apply to test data set

ETAS model is too complicated. Above model is just as good.
Stark's contention is that you can find a simple formula that beats earthquakes

So thus going forward, we want to be able to fully understand the models currently available to us and see what we can do to improve upon them.
