This week, we worked together in our groups to try to tackle beating the ETAS model that Luen attempted in his dissertation. We concluded that having an approach that was more complicated than Luen's MDA but less complex than ETAS was a helpful heuristic for us as we moved ahead.

So moving forward, we've come to the point where instead of deriving a nice, succinct function, we'll instead write an algorithm to describe what to do (when to turn on alarm and how long to turn it on for) based on empirical data. 

Tomorrow, we will be meeting as a group to discuss how we can begin implementing this algorithm so that we can present something to the class the following week. Hopefully we'll be able to get closer to our final goal when we present at the Data Science faire in December.
