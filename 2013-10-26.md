This week we did a code review of our visualizations of earthquake data, something that we will be doing in the near future. We saw that several people approached the problem differently, but the main thing that we had to accomplish was making our code reproducible. People who were successfull at this implemented such features as a hash function to cache the data, things that we had not yet learned yet.

To avoid a few code smells, I realized that it should be common practice to avoid if then else blocks when dictionaries or a library would work just as well. 

For the rest of the semester, we're about to proceed to the main chunk of our project, namely generating and writing a paper to investigate earthquake prediction. To do this, we need to all know our respective roles (curators, analyzers, visualizers, and presenters) as well as our vertical and horizontal groups. We will be developing a simple model to see whether or not that is better or worse than the complex models currently in the literature.

What are we going to make?
- a reproducible program (a model-ETAS, Stark, Poisson), (data-where from, fomrats), (inputs/outputs?), (github, laptop, amazon webservices)
- paper (abstract, intro, methodds, results (negative results), citations)
- public understanding of science (update wikipedia)

I think it will be vital for us all to keep in communication and help one another out when we struggle. Also going to office hours for technical help on programming or methodologies will be essential for success.
