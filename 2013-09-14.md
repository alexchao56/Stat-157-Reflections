This week, we tried installing and getting up and running the programming environment we would be using for the rest of the class. While the previous week was spent getting us familiar with the different technologies of the class such as VirtualBox, git, and ipython, we wanted to transition to a point where we could set up a work environment in a matter of minutes with a few simple steps. 

However, this is where several people, inclduing myself, ran into some roadblocks. Specifically for me, I was able to download the Vagrant machine onto my computer and even intialize a Vagrant file. The problem arose when I actually tried to start Vagrant with the "vagrant up" command. I run into an error saying that the box "base" could not be found. 

It seemed that multiple people encountered this problem and as of now we have yet to find a comprehensive solution to addresss such issues. But we were able to glean important lessons from this such as the necessity of communication not only with the teacher but also with our fellow team members and peers. Collaboration is key in this class and we've realized time and time again that the more we help each other and communicate effectively, the faster we can begin getting into actual work. 

One feature of the past week that I really enjoyed was the actual forming of the teams. We had over the past weekend filled out a survey indicating our strengths, weaknesses, and learning styles and from there we were able to glean teams that featured a technical lead and an operational facillitator. As one of our first activities as a team, we spent a fair amount of time doing an activity called a plus and delta table. Each of us went around listing the different pluses of the class so far and also some of the things we would like to change (the delta). From there we were able to get a clearer idea of what the teacher and GSIs could do to aid in our understanding as well as what we as students and team members had to do to help one another out. This was an extremely helpful activity and was good in providing clarity and structure for the class. 

Over this weekend, we were assigned to watch a [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB2iYzKeej8) by Eric Burlow, an ecologist and complexity scientist. In his talk he discussed how complex does not always equal complicated and that through visualization tools and other strategies, simple answers may emerge in the midst of the complexity. In a class such as this, a lot of the data science tasks that we'll be doing will be quite complex, and the answers we'll be looking for may seem complicated. However, using the various tools at our disposal, we can hopefully attain simple and insightful answers.
