For this week, we met up with our respective vertical and horizontal groups to try to make some progress on our overall project. 

I would say that we were able to make some progress in it as more of us became familiar with what we should be doing going forward. More specifically, I know that we have been in contact with Luen, Stark, and others who would be able to lend insight to our efforts. Hopefully the next time we reconvene as a class, we'll be able to take all the information we've gathered and then develop concrete plans of attack for all of our groups to take care of. 

One of the challenges that we have at least on the visualizer side, is that so far a lot of our visualizations have been exploratory, meaning that we mostly were plotting things to get some idea of what could be an interesting parameter or trend. Now, moving forward, we want to make plots that are truly meaningful in displaying what our main project is all about. To do this, we need to actively communicate with the analyzers to see what exactly they want our groups to visualize.
