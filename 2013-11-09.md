s past week and the weekend prior we really started to get started for the main project for the rest of the semester. While it may have been a long time coming, what I have noticed is that all of the students are beginning to become more serious and collaborative for the task at hand.

One of the great things that we began doing was having actual substance during our horizontal group meetings. For instance during one of our presenter meetings, we essentially outlined what each of our vertical groups had to accomplish from now until our deadline December 12 and set reasonable and tangible goals for our groups to accomplish for each meeting. This was  in my opinion the first time that the entire class and not just a few individuals came together to tackle this large scale project.

Essentially the class has now turn to a student led class with Aaron and the other GSIs in the background ready to answer our questions. Going forward, I would still like the instructors to hold workshops and other info sessions that can better equip us to handle the task. Things like python workshops, d3 visualization tutorials, and others would be great to have. At the end of the course I want to say that I learned and had experience in a data analysis tool that I did not know before. Hopefully this could be done on top of the office hours already in place. Another option is for us as a group to go to one of the data centers on campus and have them give us a tutorial on how to use these various tools. With only a few weeks left in the semester hopefully we all can do something that will leave us with skills to take back to our various fields and future ambitions.
