This week, we spent most of our class time and discussions trying to set up our programming and reproducibility environment. Several of the topics such as using git and creating a virtualbox with ubuntu was and still is a bit challenging because these were things that I had never done before. However, I did find that the GSIs and Aaron were very helpful in getting set up. After seeing some examples, and being able to help some of the other students set up their system, I feel more comfortable going forward. 

I also enjoyed the system that we had set up where each student was given different colored cards and based on how we were doing, we would raise a card that indicated our understanding of the current material. 

One of the issues I had that I would change if I could go back to the beginning of the week was using the IRC chatroom more. One of the issues I had come across was already talked about in the chatroom during the weekend. So when I went to class on Tuesday, I was one of the few people who still did not have my problem resolved which potentially could have left me behind the rest of the class. Luckily, there was not much material covered as of yet so I was able to catch up quickly. Now that I know better, I'll be sure to check the chatrooms and discussion forums more often to ensure my understanding.
