The theme for this week was still getting up to speed with our local machines so that everyone was on the same page and that we could begin doing interesting data science together. 

After a week of confusion, I was finally able to get my virtualbox to work (not using Vagrant) and connect my browser to the IPython notebook thanks to the help of the GSIs. We also were introduced to one of the texts we would be using: Python for Data Analysis, a book that has relevant techniques and examples for analysis of all types of datasets. 

One of the concerns that was raised this week that needed to be further discussed was why we were spending so much time setting up our systems and why we have yet to do some in-depth data analysis. Aaron's argument was that in the spirit of reproducibility, a lot of the issues that could surface down the line (because of incompatible machines, differing processes for doing analysis, etc.) can be minimized if we spent the necessary time up-front to make sure everyone was on the same page. This discussion helped bring out another one of deep-seeded questions that people have been forming since the beginning of the semester: Why am I in this class? What do I want to get out of it? Several people made the argument that because we were not in the contexts of research and academia, the motivation for reproducibility may not be as relevant as for those who are in those fields. Many of the students expressed that they were mostly interested in the different technologies and techniques that they thought the class would teach them and less concerned with the issue of reproducibility.

So for my own answer to that question, I believe that reproducibility is a very vital part to any scientific or engineering endeavor. Even if someone is not in research or in academia, collaboration and making sure that one's work is reproducibile should be the standard for anyone doing science. Unless a person chooses to isolate himself and never share his work to the world, then whenever findings are presented, reproducible methodologies should be included as well. Thus I can understand why Aaron would want to spend so much time making sure that we are on the same page; however, I do agree with my peers that we should be able to start getting into the more interesting work of analysis and data mining.

So as for a suggestion, if Aaron or the GSIs could include a document (similar to the ones we received on the first week of clsas on github) detailing what we should set-up, how we should do it, and what expectations we should have going into each session, that would be great. Once all this initial overhead is taken care of, we can then spend more class time discussing actual data science and statistics. I think that is what all of us as students are looking to do.
