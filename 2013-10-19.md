This week we spent a good portion of our time talking about the various tools available to us for presentations. Chris shared with us how to use HTML and Javascript to essentially make slides that our interactive and available on any web browser. This certainly is a step up over Microsoft Powerpoint because all computers should have an operable web browser while not every computer has Powerpoint installed. This goes a long way in making things more reproducible. 

Another thing that we went over that I thought was helpful was more computer science terminology like scope, caches, and others. This overview was good for those who have not had much CS background and could hopefully help making the whole programming process a little easier. 

Philip Stark's lecture this week started to hone into what our term project was going to entail and gave us a birds-eye view of what we wanted to do and how we were going to do it. Essentially we are going to use an ETAS model to predict earthquakes. To do this we have to 

- estimate parameter on training data
- optimal predictor of stochastic process: conditonal intensity
- turn on alarms when the conditional intensity \lambda(t) is above some threshold

I think the main takeaway from this is for us to continue looking into the various models and assumptions of those models for us to better familiarize ourselves with what we will be doing in the near future.
