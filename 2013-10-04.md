This week focused on establishing our groups based on the survey we filled out a few weeks ago. There were four groups that people fell into: data curators, analysis producers, visualization experts, and presenters. 

We saw that the responsibilities of each group were:
* Data curator-creating structure with the raw data. Works with other curators to make sure that data is in the same format
* Analysis- coding a lot, using a lot of statistical analysis. Share techniques with other analyzers
* Visualization - using tools to make the data more communicable 
* Presenter- communicates the results. Needs to know what the questions are and aggregate information and put it together. Often is the research paper

We realized from this that communication is key with people both in and outside our pipeline. In the past, groups have been divided because of competition and an unwillingness to share work; however, it is the belief of this class that the future of science is in more collaboration and we are trying out best to model this through these groups. 

So when we gathered into our groups we answered questions such as:
- What tools do we need?
- What skills should we develop
- what are our responsibilities?
- What are our outputs?
- How do we communicate with other groups?
- How do we share techniques as a group?
- What is our 'stack'? or workflow?

From there, we began exchanging information 

On Thursday, Philip came to lecture on the statistical processes that have been used so far to predict  including an enlightening exchange he had with a scientist in the field. It was an engaging lecture and we only touched the surface of how we will actually be implementing various tests and models to better understand earthquakes. I am definitely looking forward to his upcoming lectures. 

As for feedback, I think there are quite a few people in class who feel like they are being thrown into the deep end in having to figure out how to implement such tools as the IPython notebook, D3, HTML, and others. Not every student in the class comes from a computer science or programming background, so while they may be able to statistically analyze data, the actual cleaning it up and presentation of it may be a bit out of reach for some.
