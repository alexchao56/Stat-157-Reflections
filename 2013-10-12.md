This week we presented our first project for the glass, namely parsing and analyzing Google spreadhseet data. Tuesday was primarily spent for  ou presentations, while Thursday was devoted to trying to reproduce other people's work. The main takeaway from this week were the triumphs and struggles that we all experienced while trying to do this project. 

Some of the recurrring lessons we learned from this included:

- maintain readable, working code so that anybody could pick it up and know what to do. 
- hard to see reproducibility until you see someone trying to reproduce your code
- People having to pick up other's work when something fails. 
- Making sure that all plots and other visualizations are able to be easily interpretable. (i.e. violin plot not intuitive)
- Being able to communicate through other means if physical meetup is not possible.

Looking ahead, I think we can build upon all the lessons we have picked up and more and better improve our product the next time we have a project.
